# Reseach-paper-on-past-and-future-of-automonous-automation-vehicles
The field of autonomous automation has always been an area of research and this project will present a detail chronological development over the years. The proposed research paper also helps in understanding the trends in autonomous vehicle technology over the years and future. we will research the tread in an autonomous driving vehicle from the past century when the first radio-controlled vehicles were structured. In the next upcoming decades will we provide the trends on the rise of independent electric vehicles that we have today in the streets. Different semi-autonomous features that are developed in the early 19th century are still present in cars in today’s car. For example, path keeping, programmed braking, and versatile journey control depend on such frameworks. Broad arrange guided frameworks related to vision-guided features is the eventual fate of vehicles. And all these technological rises has to lead us to today’s electronic car which is much safer and more energy-efficient. This proposed paper will also research on the upcoming vehicle technology.
